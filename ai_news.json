      "title": "AI girlfriends are ruining an entire generation of men",
      "content": "The rise of virtual artificial intelligence (AI) girlfriends is enabling the silent epidemic of loneliness in an entire generation of young men. It is also having severe consequences for AmericaÆs future. \r\n\r\nHow is something that seems so ridiculous ù a virtual AI girlfriend ù causing a future crisis among Americans? Well, with millions of users, apps have created virtual girlfriends that talk to you, love you, allow you to live out your erotic fantasies, and learn, through data, exactly what you like and what you donÆt like, creating the ôperfectö relationship.\r\n\r\nThese virtual girlfriends can even be based on real people. One influencer created an AI bot of herself named Caryn, then gained over 1,000 users (i.e. real boyfriends) in less than a week and a waitlist of more than 15,000 people.  \r\n\r\nAn AI girlfriend might sound enticing. You get to connect with a super hot girl who listens to you and appreciates you, 24/7. Beyond choosing physical attributes, down to the size of her rear end, you can pick her personality. You prefer ôhot, funny, and boldö? ThatÆs what she will be. Or if ôcute, shy, and modestö is more your cup of tea, sheÆs got you covered.\r\n\r\nYes, these are real attributes you can have your AI girlfriend embody. And to be clear, these arenÆt cookie-cutter chatbot interactions. By definition, the AI learns from your reactions and is capable of giving you exactly what you want to hear or see, every single time. And they have come at just the right time to assuage the silent epidemic of loneliness that is hitting this generation of young men.  \r\n\r\nLetÆs look at the hard numbers. More than 60 percent of young men (ages 18-30) are single, compared to only 30 percent of women the same age. One in five men report not having a single close friend, a number that has quadrupled in the last 30 years. The amount of social engagement with friends dropped by 20 hours per month over the pandemic and is still decreasing.\r\n\r\nThese young men are lonely, and it is having real consequences. They are choosing AI girlfriends over real women, meaning they donÆt have relationships with real women, donÆt marry them and then donÆt have and raise babies with them. America desperately needs people to have more babies, but all the signs are pointing toward fewer relationships, fewer marriages and fewer babies. There have been 600,000 fewer births in 2023 in the U.S. relative to 15 years ago. The number of children per woman has decreased by more than 50 percent in the last 60 years.  \r\n\r\nPut another way, we donÆt have enough people to work, and therefore we wonÆt be able to pay our bills, not just to other countries, but to ourselves. We spent more than $1.6 trillion in 2021 on Medicare and Medicaid, with the number of Americans on Medicare expected to increase by 50 percent by 2030, to more than 80 million people. But over the same period, we will have only 10 million more Americans joining the workforce."

      "title": "What It Looks Like When AI Designs a City",
      "content": "Generative design tools powered by artificial intelligence stand to transform how architects and planners do their jobs, and how residents see urban problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Patrick Sisson\r\nSeptember 16, 2023 at 8:00 AM EDT\r\nWhen designers laboring away on a virtual cityscape began observing and tweaking their creation, one of the first things that jumped out at them, when they scanned down boulevards or looked across main streets, was the trees. More aptly, it was the unsettling lack of tree cover.\r\n\r\nThe streets of InfiniCity, a model 3D city synthesis built using AI that was released earlier this year, can appear a bit like a crude crayon-on-cardboard metropolis. The project renders an unending artificial city via a multi-step process; a series of software programs work together, pulling in satellite data and using other design tools and algorithms to create a streetscape users can endlessly cruise. Co-developer Chieh Hubert Lin says the goal is to ôautomatically recreate lifelike real-world cities,ö generated entirely from the imagination of a synthetic mind.\r\n\r\nAs mesmerizing as InfiniCity looks, you wouldnÆt want to live in this urban ouroboros. Early versions lacked greenery ù the geometry of foliage was too fine-grained for the computer to render, Li says ù and the built environment is a mish-mash of wonky-looking buildings on streets that randomly dead-end or empty unexpectedly into lakes. ItÆs sort of a 3D vision of a ChatGPT-authored term paper that descends into made-up quotations and awkward grammar. The organic logic of real-world cities canÆt quite be reduced to a SimCity-esque platform just yet\r\n\r\nInfiniCityÆs vision of a metropolis-without-end comes amid a wave of interest in the use of artificial intelligence to perform feats of human-like creativity. The latest generation of AI-powered image-making and planning tools can utilize large datasets and neural models to render buildings and cityscapes that range from the uncannily plausible to the purely fantastical; numerous fictional examples created via programs like Midjourney can be found online. Meanwhile, city officials are beginning to wrestle with the relevance ù and risk ù of AI in urban governance (also the topic of a recent United Nations report).\r\n\r\nRead more: Why the AI revolution will be urban\r\n\r\nThe goal of automating aspects of urban design and planning in order to reduce costs and improve the final product predates this current crop of generative design tools, notes Imdat As, an architect and co-editor of The Routledge Companion to Artificial Intelligence in Architecture. Computer-aided design, or CAD, software used in the design process emerged in the 1960s and has been in wide use since the 1980s, when Peter Eisenman used computer modeling to create his unrealized Biocenter project for the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt and Frank Gehry, whose firm would famously develop their own digital design interface, experimented with CAD. Today, technology such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), digital twins and generative design are used across the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nSponsored Content\r\nAs More Organizations Move to the Cloud, They Need to Up Their Cyber Defenses\r\nBloomberg\r\nPrograms such as Delve, a generative real estate design tool from Alphabet-affiliated Sidewalk Labs, and Forma (formerly the Swedish company Spacemaker that was acquired by Autodesk for $240 million) are being used to plan neighborhood-scale projects. Forma can help developers adjust for sunlight and wind on large housing projects, for instance. Spacemaker CEO Hσvard Haukeland has said that these toolsÆ ability to quickly devise and incorporate things like plumbing and power lines into proposed plans avoids what he calls ôoh s--tö moments later on.\r\n\r\nBut issues of quality and data bias can skew the usefulness of these applications, and underscore that the dream (or nightmare) of an entirely AI-planned city remains out of reach ù for now."

      "content": "With its investment of up to $4 billion, Amazon is seeking a bigger footprint in A.I. development, one already established by rivals like Microsoft and Google.\r\nAmazon said on Monday that it would invest up to $4 billion in the artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic, as the worldÆs biggest technology companies race to benefit from A.I. breakthroughs that could reshape parts of their businesses ù and the economy as a whole.\r\n\r\nAmazon is trying to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Google, which have each poured billions of dollars into A.I. research. Anthropic, seen as one of the most promising of a batch of A.I. start-ups, will use AmazonÆs data centers, cloud-computing platform and A.I. chips.\r\n\r\nThe deal underscores the frenzy to be at the forefront of A.I., a technology that has seized the publicÆs imagination and has the power to potentially transform the way people work and live. As part of that race, tech giants have been teaming with up-and-coming A.I. start-ups by providing them with computing power and cash to help them develop new models and applications. Google has also invested in Anthropic, while Microsoft has poured $13 billion into OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.\r\n\r\nAmazonÆs investment of up to $4 billion would give it a minority stake in Anthropic, it said.\r\n\r\nLike OpenAI, Anthropic is a developer of so-called generative A.I., the technology capable of learning from vast amounts of data to create humanlike texts and images. These tools are seen as possessing the potential to automate many tasks, reshaping aspects of the global economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthropic, which operates a chatbot called Claude, has sought to position itself as one of the industryÆs more responsible actors. Its executives have warned that A.I. could cause tremendous damage to society if not developed carefully. The companyÆs co-founder Jack Clark attended a recent meeting on Capitol Hill to discuss A.I. policy, including the risks and potential of the rapidly evolving technology.\r\n\r\nA New Generation of Chatbots\r\n\r\nA brave new world. A new crop of chatbots powered by artificial intelligence has ignited a scramble to determine whether the technology could upend the economics of the internet, turning todayÆs powerhouses into has-beens and creating the industryÆs next giants. Here are the bots to know:\r\n\r\nChatGPT. ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence language model from a research lab, OpenAI, has been making headlines since November for its ability to respond to complex questions, write poetry, generate code, plan vacations and translate languages. GPT-4, the latest version introduced in mid-March, can even respond to images (and ace the Uniform Bar Exam).\r\n\r\nBing. Two months after ChatGPTÆs debut, Microsoft, OpenAIÆs primary investor and partner, added a similar chatbot, capable of having open-ended text conversations on virtually any topic, to its Bing internet search engine. But it was the botÆs occasionally inaccurate, misleading and weird responses that drew much of the attention after its release.\r\n\r\nBard. GoogleÆs chatbot, called Bard, was released in March to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain. Originally conceived as a creative tool designed to draft emails and poems, it can generate ideas, write blog posts and answer questions with facts or opinions.\r\n\r\nErnie. The search giant Baidu unveiled ChinaÆs first major rival to ChatGPT in March. The debut of Ernie, short for Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration, turned out to be a flop after a promised ôliveö demonstration of the bot was revealed to have been recorded.\r\n\r\nWorking with Anthropic also helps Amazon, which is competing against Microsoft and Google in cloud computing and has been trying to establish itself more deeply in artificial intelligence. Amazon is also battling Nvidia as a provider of the chips needed to run complex A.I. systems.\r\n\r\nThe huge amounts of money and computing power needed to run A.I. models have made it nearly impossible for smaller companies to remain independent from established tech giants with deep pockets.\r\n\r\nAnthropicÆs partnership with Amazon is also another example of a new kind of circular business arrangement that can be mutually beneficial to both cloud computing companies and A.I. start-ups.\r\n\r\nAnthropic will pump much of the money itÆs raising from Amazon back into the company as it pays for time on the massive clusters of computer servers operated by the Seattle tech giant. So while Amazon is making a strategic investment in a start-up, it is also feeding its own cloud-computing business, which now accounts for more than 70 percent of its profits.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrosoft first created this kind of deal with OpenAI in 2019. In recent months, other cloud computing companies, including Google and Oracle, have made similar arrangements with ambitious A.I. start-ups.\r\n\r\nWhile Microsoft and Google have also launched their own online chatbots in the months since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT, Amazon has not followed suit. Instead, it has worked to provide various tools for companies and independent developers looking to build their own chatbots and other A.I. technologies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to boosting its cloud computing revenues, AmazonÆs agreement with Anthropic could raise its profile in the field and fuel the development of new A.I. technologies inside the tech giant.\r\n\r\nôWe can help improve many customer experiences, short- and long-term, through our deeper collaboration,ö Andy Jassy, AmazonÆs chief executive, said in a statement."

      "title": "Getty Images launches an AI-powered image generator",
      "content": "Getty Images, one of the largest suppliers of stock images, editorial photos, videos and music, today announced the launch of a generative AI art tool that it claims is ôcommercially saferö than other, rival solutions on the market.\r\n\r\nCalled Generative AI by Getty Images, the tool ù powered by an AI model provided by Nvidia, with whom Getty has a close technical partnership ù was trained on a portion of GettyÆs vast library (~477 million assets) of stock content. Along the lines of popular text-to-image platforms like OpenAIÆs DALL-E 3 and Midjourney, GettyÆs tool renders images from text descriptions of the images, or prompts ù e.g. ôphoto of a sandy tropical island filled with palm trees.ö\r\n\r\nCustomers creating and downloading visuals using the tool will receive GettyÆs standard royalty-free license, Getty says, which includes indemnification ù i.e., protection against copyright lawsuits ù and the right to ôperpetual, worldwide, nonexclusiveö use across all media.\r\n\r\nThe tool isnÆt completely unfettered, however.\r\n\r\nWhile GettyÆs content library includes depictions of public figures, Getty says that itÆs imposed safeguards to prevent its generative tool from being used for disinformation or misinformation ù or from replicating the style of a living artist. For example, the tool wonÆt let a customer create a photo of Joe Biden in front of the White House or a cat in the style of Andy Warhol, reports The Verge, which had access to the tool ahead of its release. And all images created by the tool contain a watermark identifying them as AI-generated.\r\n\r\nôWeÆve worked hard to develop a responsible tool that gives customers confidence in visuals produced by generative AI for commercial purposes,ö Craig Peters, CEO at Getty Images, said in a press release.\r\nGetty says that content generated by its tool wonÆt be added to its content library for others to license (but reserves the right to retrain its model using those images) and that Getty contributors whose works are used to train the underlying model will be compensated. Getty will also share revenues generated from the tool, it says, allocating both a per-file proportional share and a share based on traditional licensing revenue.\r\n\r\nôOn an annual recurring basis, we will share in the revenues generated from the tool with contributors whose content was used to train the AI generator,ö a Getty spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. ôThere will be a set formula based on a number of different factors, and accordingly each contributor will receive different payments in connection with the tool.ö\r\n\r\nThe tool can be enabled on GettyÆs website or integrated into apps and websites through an API, and soon, customers will be able to customize it with proprietary data to create images consistent with a particular brand style or design language. Pricing will be separate from a standard Getty Images subscription and based on prompt volume, Getty says.\r\n\r\nôWeÆve created a service that allows brands and marketers to safely embrace AI and stretch their creative possibilities, while compensating creators for inclusion of their visuals in the underlying training sets,ö Grant Farhall, chief product officer at Getty, said in a canned statement.\r\n\r\nPrior to the launch of its own tool, Getty had been a vocal critic of generative AI products like Stable Diffusion, which was trained on a subset of its image content library. Earlier this year, Getty sued AI startup Stability AI, which was involved with the creation of Stable Diffusion, for allegedly copying and processing millions of images and associated metadata owned by Getty without informing or compensating Getty contributors.\r\n\r\nPeters has previously compared the current legal landscape in the generative AI scene to the early days of digital music, where companies like Napster offered popular but illegal services before new deals were struck with license holders like music labels. ôWe think similarly these generative models need to address the intellectual property rights of others, thatÆs the crux of it,ö he told The Verge in an interview in January. ôAnd weÆre taking [legal] action to get clarity.ö\r\n\r\nSome companies developing generative AI tools, including Stability AI, argue that their content scraping practices are protected by fair use doctrine ù at least in the U.S. But itÆs a matter thatÆs unlikely to be settled anytime soon.\r\n\r\nGetty isnÆt the only company exploring ôsafer,ö more ethical approaches (in the commercial sense) to generative AI, itÆs worth noting.\r\n\r\nAI startup Bria offers a generative AI art tool trained on content that Bria licenses from partners, including individual photographers and artists, as well as media companies and stock image repositories, which receive a portion of the companyÆs revenue. Recently launched avatar creator Ascendant Art, meanwhile, is promising to pay royalties to the artists who voluntarily submit their artwork to train its models.\r\n\r\nItÆs not just startups. Getty Images rival Shutterstock reimburses creators whose work is used to train AI art models. Adobe, meanwhile, says that itÆs developing a compensation model for contributors to Adobe Stock, its stock content library, thatÆll allow them to ômonetize their talentsö and benefit from any revenue its generative AI technology, Firefly, brings in."
